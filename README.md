Finding Complete Impossible Differential Attacks on AndRX Ciphers and Efficient Distinguishers for ARX Designs
This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Finding Complete Impossible Differential Attacks on AndRX Ciphers and Efficient Distinguishers for ARX Designs".

## Overview

This repository contains the following directories:
- `Deterministic-ID-ARX-AND-RX`: The code and data for the deterministic impossible differential distinguisher on ARX and AndRX designs.
- `Deterministic-ZC-ARX-AND-RX`: The code and data for the deterministic zero-correlation distinguisher on ARX and AndRX designs.
- `ID-KeyRecovery-ANDRX`: The code and data for the key recovery attack using the impossible differential on AndRX designs.

We will soon update the repositary with all the codes. Till then, please feel free to contact in debasmitachakraborty1@gmail.com
